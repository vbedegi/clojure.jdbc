== Version 0.6.1

Date: 2015-08-26

- Remove potemkin dependency.


== Version 0.6.0

Date: 2015-08-14

- Remove deprecated code.
- Update dependencies.


== Version 0.5.1

Date: 2015-04-28

- Update dependencies versions.
- Minor fix on tests.


== Version 0.5.0

Date: 2015-03-29

This is an other release focused in simplify the main api. It deprecates the old api but
maintains full backward compatibility until 0.6.0.

- New `execute` function in terms of abstraction. This method replaces the `execute!`
  and `execute-prepared!` functions.
- New `fetch` function in terms of abstraction. This method replaces the `query`
  function.
- New transaction api based in new `atomic` macro and `atomic-apply` function located
  now on core ns. The old functions (`call-in-transaction` and `with-transaction`) are
  still available in now deprecated `jdbc.transaction` namespace.
- New name to lazy-query: fetch-lazy.

The major change of this release is make all query/statement executin functions works
in terms of generic abstractions defined as protocols. The api is highly influenced
by `suricatta` api, making it mostly compatible with it.


== Version 0.4.0

Date: 2015-02-07

- Fix wrong parsing boolean values in MSSQL (thanks to @vbedegi).


== Version 0.4.0-beta1

Date: 2015-01-11


This release is focused to simplify the code and use more clojure native constructions
like `with-open` instead of own defined macros.

Relevant changes:

- Connection is not longer defined as defrecord. It breaks apps that relies on hash-map
  interface of the connection. Now the connection is more extensible and it is defined
  in terms of protocols.
- `with-connection` macro is marked as deprecated, now the recommended way to handle
  connection resources is using clojure builtin `with-open` macro.
- The `make-query` function is replaced by `lazy-query`. It is not simple rename.
  `lazy-query` function returns some kind of cursor object. That cursor allows create an
  arbitrary number of lazyseqs (with new `cursor->lazyseq function) executing a query
  using server side cursors if them are available.
- Removed `with-query` macro (because it depends on now also removed `make-query` function)
  and the behavior is replaced by `lazy-query`.

Other changes:

- Set more consistent name to protocol and protocol method that responsible for create preapare
  statements: `ISQLStatement/normalize` -> `IPreparedStatementConstructor/prepared-statement`
- Make connection constructor extensible and implemented as `IConnectionConstructor` protocol.
- The function responsible of creating a connection, is renamed: `make-connection` -> `connection`
  (conserving an alias for backward compatibility).
- Remove the `:connection-uri` option because is almost same thing that uri.
- Deprecated dbspecs with datasource as key. Now datasource instances can be passed directly to
  `connection` function without wrapping it in a hash-map.
- The `connection` function now accepts a optional second parameter in case when dbspec is not
  in clojure hash-map format.
- Deprecated own connection pool extensions. Because they are less flexible that creating own
  datasource instance. The documentation is updated with examples of how to create datasource
  instances for all previously supported connection pool implementations.
- Move the rollback flag check to transaction strategy, instead of having it hardcoded in the
  call-in-transaction function. This change simplifies a little bit creating own transaction
  strategies implementations, removing unnecesary accidental complexity.

  backward compatibility but it will be removed in 0.3

  as sql value.
- Pretty dbspec format.
- Read only connections.
- Set schema to connection.


== Version 0.1.1

Date: 2014-04-06

- Connection pooling is splited to separate module (it preserves same api, but should be
  declared as additional dependency if you want use it).
- Set clojure 1.6 as default clojure version.
- Add apache-commonds dbcp 2.0 connection pool support.
- Breaking change: rename transaction strategy methods to: begin! rollback! commit!
- Breaking change: call-in-transaction now accepts options map insted of named parameters.
- Fix bugs on marking transaction rollback-only.
- Allow set isolation level for transaction.
- Allow set read-only transaction.

== Version 0.1-rc1

Date: 2014-02-16

- jdk6 support added (`java.lang.AutoCloseable` interface is replaced
  with `java.io.Closeable` interface)
- Add ISQLStatement protocol for make easy extend query (and friends) function parameter.
- Performance improvements (with micro bench suite)
- Changed syntax for `with-connection` for more idiomatic way (previous behavior
  mantained for backward compatibility).

== Version 0.1-beta5

Date: 2014-01-21

Note: this should be a last beta release.

- Query functions (make-query, query and with-query) now accepts prepared statements.
- Add ability to extend all behavior between some type is set as parameter to prepared statement
  and retrieved from resultset thanks to `ISQLType` and `ISQLResultSetReadColumn` (this allows
  extend not default types, making it compatible for pass as paramater to jdbc and extend sql types for
  automatically convert them to custom types when are retrieved from resultset).
- Refactored jdbc.types namespace (rename QueryResult to ResultSet and put each type in their own
  namespace and add additional util functions for each type).
- Move all transactions logic to separate namespace, removing it from a main jdbc namespace
  (breaking change).
- Rename `execute-statement` to `execute-statement!` for more concise function naming.
- Remove untested and unused `execute-statement->query-result` function.


== Version 0.1-beta4

Date: 2013-12-14

- Now transaction management is extensible. ITransactionStrategy is exposed and 
  DefaultTransactionStrategy is a default implementation that cases with previous transaction 
  behavior. If you want other transaction strategy, just implement ITransactionStrategy protocol 
  and pass it to `call-in-transaction` function.
- Custom sql types now supported. Extend your type with ISQLType protocol and implement `as-sql-type`
  function for it, that should return database compatible type.
- Backward incompatible change: `mark-as-rollback-only!`, `unmark-rollback-only!` and
  `is-rollback-only?` are renamed to more concise names: `set-rollback!`, `unset-rollback!`
  and `is-rollback-set?`
- Rollback behavior changed. Now rollback functions only affects a current transaction or
  subtransaction and it never interferes in parent transactions.
- Ensuers inmutablity on connection instance on transaction blocks. Now transaction blocks has only one
  clear defined side-effect: commit/rollback/setAutoCommit operations. Rollback flag is more limited
  side-effect that only change state of connection for current transaction.
- Simplify isolation level setting. Now only can set isolation level on dbspec or on creating connection.
  All global state is removed.


== Version 0.1-beta3

Date: 2013-12-08

- Minor code cleaning and function name consistency fixes.
- Expose more private functions as public.
- Fix wrong preconditions and some bugs introduced in previos version.
- Add more tests.


== Version 0.1-beta2

Date: 2013-11-25

- Remove some taken code from clojure.java.jdbc
  that are licensed under epl.
- Add ability to set the isolation level.
- Add new `query` function.
- Change default behavior for querying a database: now the default
  behavior is evaluate a request because of all jdbc implementation
  retrieves all resulset in memory and use lazy-seq is totally useless.


== Version 0.1-beta1

Date: 2013-11-14

- Initial relase
